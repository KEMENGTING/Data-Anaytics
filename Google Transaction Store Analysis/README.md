# About the project
Using <strong><em>Big Query</em></strong> and <strong><em>Python</em></strong> to conduct EDA from Google Transaction Store Dataset (data from 201608 to 201708)

# Difficulties faced

Some columns are <strong><em>nested data columns</em></strong> which means there is more than one data/record in one session/row.
